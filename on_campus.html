                        Harvard College Engineering Society (HCES) is the oldest engineering group 
                        on campus, serving as an umbrella organization to many groups such as WiCS, 
                        SWE, SHPE, NSBE, HURC, etc. As one of the largest organizations on campus, 
                        HCES has come a long way to become a prominent voice in the SEAS community 
                        to help students from mentorship (Big E & Little E, E-PAFs, course selection) 
                        tocareer development (resume reviews, resume book, tech talks, 
                        industry tours) to community (Welcome Kits, Field Day, Friday Lunches).

                        The River Charles Ensemble, Harvardâ€™s premier conductor-less 
                        chamber orchestra, is dedicated to the highest quality of 
                        music-making and performance. Formed in the spring of 2012, 
                        the River Charles Ensemble is a community of musicians who 
                        believe in the power and application of chamber music techniques 
                        to solo and orchestral performances. Using a democratic and 
                        collective approach, the orchestra is dedicated to working 
                        with student musicians of all kinds and strongly believes 
                        in musical collaborations all across the Harvard community. 
                        The musicians of the River Charles Ensemble share a passion 
                        for this distinctive and innovative approach to music.
